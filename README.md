# ðŸ“– Collaborative Writing Platform

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This is a GitHub-style **collaborative writing platform** designed to enable multiple users to contribute to a document in real-time, submit changes as "pull requests," and merge updates seamlessly. Inspired by Notion's block-based editing and GitHub's PR workflow, the platform ensures **conflict-free collaboration** using CRDTs.

### ðŸŒŸ Why This Project?

- Traditional document collaboration tools like Google Docs lack structured version control.
- GitHub works well for code but isn't optimized for content writing.
- Notion offers flexibility but lacks a **Git-like workflow** for document edits.
- This platform combines the best of both worldsâ€”**real-time collaboration + versioning & PR-based merging**.
